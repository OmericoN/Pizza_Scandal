# The Great EU Pizza Database Project üçïüá™üá∫

## Backstory: The Great EU Pizza Scandal

It all started in Brussels, in what the media now calls **The Great Pizza Scandal of 2027**.

For years, a few massive online pizza-ordering platforms had quietly taken over the market. Almost every pizza in Europe ‚Äî from a Naples Neapolitan to a Finnish reindeer-topped pie ‚Äî was ordered through the same two or three apps.

### Then came the investigation.

EU regulators discovered that these platforms were:

- Charging hidden "oregano taxes" to restaurants
- Replacing real mozzarella with "digitally enhanced cheese-like product" in photos
- Using AI to auto-swap your order to "whatever was cheapest for them that day"
- And worst of all‚Ä¶ secretly ranking Brussels-style endive-and-anchovy pizza as "Most Popular" in all countries.

The final straw came when the platforms accidentally declared pineapple pizza an EU cultural heritage dish.

The public outrage was immediate. MEPs debated for 14 hours straight.
One impassioned speech ended with the now-famous line:

> "We must take back control‚Ä¶ slice by slice!" üçï

**The result:** EU Regulation 2028/PI-ZZ-A.

Centralized pizza ordering was banned. Every pizzeria must now run its own independent ordering system ‚Äî no shared apps, no shady algorithms, no pineapple unless you really want it.

**That's where you come in.**

Mamma Mia's Pizza has hired you to build their database-driven ordering system so they can thrive in this brave new post-scandal pizza economy.

## Project Description

You will work in two connected layers:

### 1. Database Layer
- Design an ERD
- Create a relational schema with constraints
- Populate tables with realistic data
- Write SQL queries and transactions to answer the restaurant's needs

### 2. Programming Layer
- Small console program (or minimal web UI)
- Uses SQL queries to:
  - Display menu
  - Place orders
  - Apply discounts
  - Assign delivery drivers
  - Generate staff reports

---

## Deliverables

At the end of the 6 weeks, you will submit:

- **Final ERD** (PDF or image)
- **SQL schema** (CREATE TABLE statements with constraints)
- **Sample data** (INSERT statements)
- **SQL queries** (reports, discounts, advanced queries, transactions)
- **Program source code** (Java, Python, or another approved language)
- **Video presentation** (5‚Äì10 min)

> ‚ùó **This project is designed for 2 people.** Please go to the People page in Canvas and join a group with another student.

## Video Presentation Requirements

Your only graded submission is a recorded presentation (max 10 minutes) in which you:

1. Introduce your project
2. Explain your database design using your ERD
3. Show the database in action
4. Run a few SQL queries directly in your DB client
5. Demonstrate your application:
   - Place an order, apply a discount, assign a driver
   - Show at least two staff reports
6. Highlight transactions and constraints
7. Show what happens if invalid data is inserted
8. Conclude with what you learned

You may use screen recording + voiceover or appear on camera if you wish.

## ‚úÖ Project Functional Specification Checklist

Use this checklist to track what your pizza system supports. All core features must be implemented. Bonus features are optional, but great for depth and higher marks.

### üçï Core Features (Required)

#### üìã Menu & Pricing
- [ ] Menu displays pizzas, drinks, and desserts from the database
- [ ] Pizzas are linked to ingredients (many-to-many)
- [ ] Pizza price is calculated dynamically:
  - Ingredient costs
  - 40% margin
  - 9% VAT
- [ ] No price column is stored directly in the pizza table
- [ ] Vegetarian/vegan labels are shown based on ingredients

#### üßë‚Äçüíº Customer & Order Management
- [ ] Customers can be added with full info (name, birthdate, address, etc.)
- [ ] Orders can be placed with:
  - One or more pizzas (mandatory)
  - Optional drinks and desserts
- [ ] Order confirmation includes all items and total price

#### üéÅ Discounts & Loyalty
- [ ] Customers get 10% off after 10 pizzas (tracked over time)
- [ ] One-time discount codes can be redeemed (only once)
- [ ] On their birthday, customers get:
  - 1 free pizza (cheapest)
  - 1 free drink
- [ ] Discounts are applied dynamically in SQL or application logic

#### üöö Delivery Assignment
- [ ] Delivery personnel are assigned to postal codes
- [ ] Orders are assigned to a delivery person based on customer's postcode
- [ ] A delivery person becomes unavailable for 30 minutes after delivery
- [ ] Delivery status is tracked and visible

#### üìä Reports (Staff Interface)
- [ ] Undelivered orders are displayed
- [ ] Top 3 pizzas sold in the past month
- [ ] Earnings reports filtered by:
  - Gender
  - Age group
  - Postal code

#### üîÑ Database Transactions & Constraints
- [ ] Placing an order is wrapped in a transaction
- [ ] Rollback occurs if any part of the order fails
- [ ] Constraints are enforced:
  - Vegetarian pizzas don't contain meat
  - Valid date of birth
  - Ingredient costs are > 0
  - Discount codes are unique and single-use

### ‚ú® Bonus Features (Optional but encouraged)

#### üí° Database Design & Querying
- [ ] Use views to encapsulate logic (e.g. menu with prices, veg filters)
- [ ] Use stored functions/procedures (e.g. for price calculation, discount logic)
- [ ] Create and use indexes to optimize slow queries
- [ ] Use check constraints creatively to enforce business rules

#### ‚è± Time & Temporal Logic
- [ ] Use timestamps to manage:
  - Delivery timing
  - Order cancellation window (e.g., cancel within 5 minutes)
- [ ] Monthly/weekly sales queries use SQL date/time functions

#### üß™ Testing & Data Generation
- [ ] Generate realistic test data using SQL scripts or Python tools (e.g. Faker)
- [ ] Include at least 20 sample orders across different timeframes

#### üõ°Ô∏è Design Thinking & Security (Discussed or Implemented)
- [ ] Discussed or implemented access control ideas (e.g. staff vs customer)
- [ ] Prevented obvious forms of misuse or data entry mistakes

### üé• Final Video Presentation (All Parts are Required)

Make sure your final video:

- [ ] Shows your ERD and explains your design
- [ ] Demonstrates placing an order and applying a discount
- [ ] Shows pizza price calculation working correctly
- [ ] Shows at least 2 staff reports running live
- [ ] Shows 1 transaction in action (including rollback if you dare)
- [ ] Ends with a reflection on what you learned or what surprised you

## Week-by-Week Plan

**Goals:**
- Understand the project context (EU pizza scandal)
- Identify main entities and relationships
- Normalize the data model
- Practice writing ER diagrams
